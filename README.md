Greetings! I'm Jack from Guangzhou, China. I'm committed to achieving fluency in English, aspiring to use it as my primary language.
My primary focus in software development is the exciting field of IoT. I have strong programming skills in C and Java, which I actively apply to embedded systems.
My experience extends to working with popular microcontrollers like STM32 and ESP32, where I enjoy tackling challenges in device programming and connectivity.
I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and contribute to impactful projects.
Whether you're working on an IoT solution, an embedded project, or anything else interesting, I'm keen to connect and potentially collaborate.
